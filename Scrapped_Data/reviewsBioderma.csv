  I was really looking forward to this however the bottle did not spray/vaporize. Only tiny water droplets came out :(((

    Smells bad
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Smells bad like sulfur-ish. Bottle looks old & banged up. I feel like I paid too much for this product. I don’t wash my face in the morning. I rather use a cotton pad & swipe a hydrating toner, rose water, etc. to clean my face & pre it for my morning skin care & sunscreen. It’s gentle, does not irritate my eyes or anything. I rather go back to my rose water for the scent alone. That does not irritate my eyes either. Will not repurchase.

  Bought this specifically to wet my skin between layers or skincare products. I absolutely love it for that. The spray evenly distributes the product and it feels so refreshing on the face.  I would definitely purchase this again!

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Hmmm... not sure what I think because I haven’t brought myself to use it yet. Ordered as a facial mist to set my makeup after seeing a YouTuber recommend it for the same. Was shocked when the product arrived—dirty, dented, scratched up, dusty. It looked like it had been through an ordeal, lol. I haven’t had the time to return, so it’s still sitting on my bathroom shelf until I have the courage to use.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Firstly, where's the bottle cap? The next thing is I wonder if some of the bottles you sold are old and used. First time I ordered this, my bottle was so light! It was likely to be half of the amount but I tried to tell myself that it might be my weird inner feeling. But when I hold the new bottle, I know I was right! The new one is much heavier and full (but there is no bottle cap!?!). Please explain this!

    The smell...
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The initial smell of the product was very chemically.. I originally bought this product to spray before applying my hyaluronic acid. but the initial smell has me hesitant to use it regularly on my skin..  It is not moisturizing but i knew that the product was not meant to moisturize and did not purchase for that reason.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I use this when my skin feels dry or slightly irritated, and it pretty much calms the sensation down. It feels even more amazing in the summer because of it’s cool-down effect. Recently gave a small bottle to my hubby for post workouts (his skin gets red easily) and he likes it a lot.

    One can at least half empty and screwy labels. Suspected fakes!
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I suspect these are fakes. One item on my food scale (in the can) weighed 13.1 and the other 5.1 one label looked like a photo copy stuck on crooked with lines the other next to it didn’t have and part cut off. The one 5.1 oz didn’t even weigh the same as one I’ve had and been using for months and yet it still weighed more at 7 oz.  Extremely disappointed in seller/Amazon. I tried to upload four photos but on my phone I can’t tell if they all uploaded.

  I don't honestly really think this spray does much at all ... but it does feel nice and cooling when applied and I do honestly use it a lot (whenever I am hot or before I prep my skin to give it a little pick me up). Again, I don't think it does much for my skin, but I do enjoy it.

    I'm pretty disappointed...
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I really like Bioderma products and have been looking for a face spray that's more than just water but won't irritate my sensitive skin and eyes. I think the product is pretty good, but I wish there was maybe some glycerin or something in it so it was a little more moisturizing and doesn't just quickly evaporate. Also... unfortunately the water seems to irritate my eyes a little bit. I've just been avoiding the eye area and that seems to work.My biggest complaint though is the pressure in the aerosol ran out so fast. I can feel and hear tons of product swishing around the can but because the pressure ran out, it's extremely hard to get out of the can. Maybe I have a defective product but I doubt it. I still want to get my money's worth, so I've been turning the can upside down and dripping it into another spray bottle I had on hand to actually use the 80% or something leftover product. I've used other aerosol face sprays like Evian and another water spray and I did not have this problem.TDLR:pros: good formulation, pretty good for sensitive skin, good brand, pretty good price for a face productcons: can't use most of the product due to pressure runningout, irritates my extremely sensitive eyes, not as moisturizing as I was hoping it would be

  After spraying the water, it has a funny smell, which reminds me of sour odour from an old hose… wonder how long these bottles have been sitting there. And if there were any contamination: it has sugar in the ingredients and when I bought it, it’s expiration date was set to be good until 2023. The bottle is under pressure and a metal material, can’t see through if there’s any corrosion inside. Now I’m using it to spray my plants…
