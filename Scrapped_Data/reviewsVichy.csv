  I love this water. It‚Äôs a more affordable alternative to Avene.  But 2/3 through the bottle, the sprayer is clogged and can‚Äôt be cleaned out.  The only way to get the water out is to take the cap off and manually push the aerosol opening to let the water pool in the top recess of the can, then pour into your hand. I see A LOT of reviews stating this problem.  I think I‚Äôll stick to the smaller size of this product in the future so I can get through the entire contents before the sprayer clogs.

    Soothes skin and aids in moisturizer application
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This mineral water spray was recommended by an Aesthetician who would finish my treatment by spraying my sensitive skin with this and then applying moisturizer. She said it was better than using a toner which could irritate my skin. Her suggestion was to spray my face and neck, and then spray my palm and then put a small amount of moisturizer in my palm, rub my hands together, and then pat the moisturizer on my face. My moisturizer is applied more evenly, and I use less product.

  This is the best for use with microcurrent devices.  All of the other water sprays I‚Äôve looked at have dangerous carcinogens in them. Everyone needs to learn the most dangerous chemical to put on ur skin and STOP buying them.  We are the only ones who are able to control the products we use. Because they companies will not stop making because the government doesn‚Äôt care.  So please educate ur selves.  Follow Penny smith on YouTube if u need help with learning. That‚Äôs where I learned.  But this product is safe for now to purchase and works at moistening ur gels used with microcurrent devices so u don‚Äôt have to use as much

    Best Toner ever
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  It is so soothing, calming on the skin. I have super sensitive , oily skin. I spray it onto my face twice or thrice a day. It doesn't irritate my skin at all. It makes my skin glow.

    Good product...VERY POOR container was a waste of product and $$$.
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The product itself, I liked but after two purchases of this container, it will not fully empty and there is a ton of product left in it. They need to change the container. It's as if the air pressure is gone. This happened not once but twice.  I thought possibly the first can was a fluke but it happened again. GSK made a toothpaste in this same type of container...again a ton of product left in the container and no way to get it out.  GSK changed their container of this toothpaste back to the original format. Vichy should do the same. I'm going to request a refund.

    Erogatore intasato due volte su due
  
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
    
  Mi spiace perch√© la Vichy √® una buona marca e questa acqua termale mi sembrava valida. Ne ho acquistate due bottigliette, in due momenti diversi, proprio perch√© pensavo dipendesse da una casualit√† sulla prima bottiglietta. Invece anche la seconda, dopo un pochino di tempo ha dato lo stesso problema. Erogatore intasato e spruzzo 'spezzato' nel centro: praticamente met√† sul collo e met√† sugli occhi, in verticale, per entrambe le bottigliette.

  I love thermal waters, I spray them on my face before applying rosehip oil on as it absorbs better.  They are better than tap for water for any delicate area. This one from Vichy is great and natural. I don't take any with added fragrances.

    AMAZING
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have extremely sensitive skin and applying the water after washing my face and letting it dry naturally really calms my skin and gives it a natural glow! I do it every day, twice a day (whenever I wash my face).  On a kore personal note, I am a huge fan of Vichy products, they are very effective for me (acqualia thermal, normaderm and etc), and bear in mind that I am very selective with products.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I absolutely love the thermal spa water! Anytime my skin is feeling dry or tight I just pull my thermal water out of my purse and spray it on my face. It works great right after a shower, when I step out of the shower my skin starts getting tight and dry but just a little spray of the thermal water refreshes the moisture in my skin and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. After learning about this product and about Vichy in general I've started recommending it to all my friends.
