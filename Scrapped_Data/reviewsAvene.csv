    Works well for rosacea skin
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have rosacea and ocular rosacea….mainly the flushing, hot kind.  This really gives me some relief.  Cools your face and eyes down.  I even bought a small one to keep in my purse.  Obviously, it is not a cure, but it does work well to cool your face down and works faster than anything else I have tried so far.  There is no scent.

    Defective Spray Tip
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This procdutive will not spray. I have tried removing the tip and cleaning. That isn't the problem, it no longer has any pressure and will not spray. A lot of water left at avery expensive price for water!UPDATE To Previous Review:This is an update to my review. I tried expressing the water without the tip and there is plenty of pressure. I ordered another can of water directly from Avene. I took the new tip from the new can and placed it on the old can. It worked as it should. Therefore, evidently there is a problem with the tips on numerous cans sold by Amazon!!!

    Somehow other waters work better for me
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Avene has great spraying bottle that distributes water well. But for some reason la Roche and Vichy work better on my very difficult skin. I still like this water, helps moisturize my normally-very-oily-but-extra-dry-during-the-wintertime skin, but I will go back to la Roche next time

  Instantly reduces redness on contact. This is my 2nd bottle (I got my first at the plastic surgeon’s office) and I’m thrilled. I use am and pm on clean skin before and after moisturizer, and whenever I need it throughout the day. Very impressive product. After a peel or dermabrasion it’s instantly  soothing.

    Great for eczema, acne, rosacea
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have very sensitive skin that reacts to many different things. It is acne-prone with eczema and rosacea, and I have to be very careful with what I use on my skin and watch what I eat, otherwise my skin will have outbreaks very easily. It reacts to numerous skin care products, it breaks out after eating lots of sugary food, and I can only use free and gentle laundry detergent.Avene doesn't give skin any fancy benefits such as moisturizing or anti-aging, but it calms down and stabilizes my skin condition. Since I started using Avene, rosacea has been much better. My face looks less reddish and way less bumpy. When I have an occasional breakout, I saturate cotton pads with Avene and keep them on my face for a while, and my skin feels better the next day. Avene is just water and I was skeptical in the beginning but now I highly recommend it to people with sensitive skin.

    Great product!!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I truly love this bottle of water.  I wish I didn’t love it, because it’s kind of expensive. But I DO love it, and I keep buying it, because it’s absolutely great.I was first introduced to it on a 13 hour flight to Asia, by the flight attendant in business class. She noticed me using a washcloth.  She came over and gave me a quick spray from her bottle, and remarkably, it felt great and made the flight better.  After that, I bought my own bottle. I felt foolish, spending money on French water.  But I absolutely do not regret buying it. And since then I restock more frequently than I would like to admit. In fact, to garner favor, I buy the small bottles and give them to flight attendants for their own personal use when I fly long-haul overseas. I believe in paying it forward, and this is one small way I can help.Not that it matters much, but I’m male, and there’s really no body products I use regularly.  I have a lousy old rusty razor blade, a generic store toothbrush, cheap bar soap and shampoo. EXCEPT THIS - I absolutely pay for it, And I don’t regret one penny of it. I don’t think I can speak highly enough about this product. It baffles my mind how crazy that is, considering it’s just a spray of water. But it truly makes me feel better.Highly recommend. Get yourself a bottle, enjoy, and don’t look back.

    Last half of bottle wouldn't spray out
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Wasn't able to get the last half of the contents of the bottle to spray.  Either the propellant was faulty, or the nozzle got clogged from the inside. I couldn't see a clog from the outside.  I believe it was the propellant, because it just gradually lost pressure.  Very unhappy that I wasn't able to use the last half of the bottle.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I know this may come off as a fake review, because how one Earth can water give you acne? That's what I thought too. But my face was full of inflamed blackheads, little pustules everywhere, and even a few cysts. They would appear like magic over night. I was at a loss and desperate; I changed my diet, changed my pillow cases, cut out supplements and skin care products one by one. This was one of the last products I eliminated,because, well, it's WATER, but as soon as I did, I stopped breaking out and my face is finally healing. Maybe it was contaminated?

  Listen. Everything that needs to be said about this product has already been said but let me say this: I have this on a subscription. I always have at least two bottles in the house just in case.My skin was once a barren wasteland, dry and cracked and PAINFUL. I could've scrubbed pans with my forehead like a brillo pad.But this stuff??? THIS STUFF???My face is now as soft as a cherub's butt. Moisturizer takes much better, I'm always soft and smooth in the face and people actually compliment me on my skin.And listen, I have a super moisturizing routine. All hydration topped off with raw vitamin e oil. I've used other face mists and sprays. None even get CLOSE to what this does, okay? Don't accept substitutions.

  I had a sample of this spray in my medicine cabinet for months before I tried it. I didn't even know what it was for. I finally tried it on a rash that my dermatologist was treating me for. He gave me a cream that burned like crazy. I sprayed this on the rash and there was INSTANT relief.  I haven't used the prescription cream since.  It's great on my legs after shaving - keeps them moist and stops the itch. Great on my face in the morning, night and in-between when I need to ""wake up""! I now have it on ""Auto-Delivery"" with Amazon. I don't know how I lived without it!

  Produces a much finer spray than other brands’ bottles, so great for skincare/cooling you down in summer. Quite a large spread of water, if that makes sense, so you can spritz a large area very quickly. It’s lasting a long time too, probably because it’s so efficient with spreading the water particles so thinly.

  Used this a few times when I first received it and had a terrible breakout a few days later—really out of the ordinary for me. I wasn’t 100% certain it was caused by the spray but I stopped using it out of caution. I just gave it another try to help soothe a sunburn (one of the product’s listed uses) and within a few minutes I was wheezing, coughing, sneezing and my skin was burning. Washed my face and felt better almost immediately. I’ve used other Avene products and loved them so I’m super disappointed by this and a little spooked by how it affected me. Maybe I got a bad batch.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I like facial sprays in between all the steps of my skin care. I was using a cica (centella) toner spray before this. Same price point for both but quantity of this far exceeds the other. I don't feel like the cica was helping with my red, sensitive skin. This has exceeded my expectations for simple mineral water. I would recommend pressing the trigger spray very minimally. I noticed when I pressed it firmly like you feel you should, it was waaaay too much water. Half press and it's the perfect amount to cover the entire face and neck. There's no scent, doesn't burn the eyes, has helped my serums and moisturizer penetrate significantly better. My skin has felt exponentially softer and smoother. I will definitely repurchase.

    Yes, it's ""just"" water, but...
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This is ""just"" water, but it's very pure water, and as a result, I think it has slightly different physical properties than tap water. For example, I live in an area of very hard water, and my hair just never gets very soft, not matter how I style it or what I put on it. If I spray this Avene water on my hair before styling, soft waves in my hair come out, my hair is soft, and even the color looks a little better (probably because of the way it lays down the cuticle of the hair). On very dry days, I spray it on my hair, and it revitalizes it without getting frizzy. And of course, when it's really hot, a light spray on my face, neck, and shoulders cools me down instantly.

  I got the 10 oz version because that seemed to be the most bang for your buck. I really wanted to hate this product because I swore I would NOT be one of those people that sprays their face with water. Now I'm converted.I will say that my skin feels softer when I use it. It feels really soothing and refreshing to spray this at night before I start layering on serums. I got the 10 oz version because that seemed to be the most bang for your buck.It's by no mean ""essential"" to my routine, but I really enjoy using it and how it feels!

    Excellent product - I won't use anything else from now on
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I initially came across this Avene product when I tried the 3 piece Avene sample kit system for hyper sensitive skin. This had made such a difference in my red, inflamed, tight, and often painful skin, that I won't use anything else. (Even the famous Clinique yellow moisturizer that I swore by previously). The system does work for sensitive skin and rosacea (I have both) if you use it every day. After 10 days, I saw a good improvement in skin. After 6 weeks, my skin is so much better. You can also use the spray over makeup if your face feels dry, tight, or inflamed during the day. I have not had a problem with it ruining my makeup or causing it to smear. It was really miserable to wake up with your face burning and inflamed every morning. If you are like me, and your sensitive skin is truly a pain, try the Avene. I hope it helps you too.

    Amazingness
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I purchased this item after a horrible experience with waxing after I had been using a retinol serum, long story short the wax took both my hair and skin, rookie mistake leaving me with a significant size blotch on my face. I was devastated and did a lot of research which lead me to find this amazingness of a product. My ""no scar regime"" was composed of this, Bio Oil, Neoporin, Cetaphil Cleanser, and Aquaphor. Five days later I am all healed with minimal visibility of skin discoloration. This product is so amazing that I will continue to purchase, as a matter in fact I find myself looking for excuses to use it including morning, night, and setting of make-up. I couldn't believe its just spring water as it leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft. If you are considering this, I highly recommend it and it is worth the price difference compared to similar, but in my opinion inferior, alternatives.

  Okay, I know what you're thinking...$19 for a bottle of water?!  I get it. I was that person. Until my dermatologist recommended it for my rosacea and severely dry skin. I gave it shot.  My poor nose, cheeks, nose and chin were so dry, flaky, and inflamed it felt like a crusty mask was on top my face.This saved my face.  I actually have soft skin on my face now!Here's my nightly routine:1) mist this on my face2) apply the Avene no-rinse cleansing milk with a soft cotton pad3) mist face again4) wait about 30-60 seconds and let this awesome water soak in a bit5) with clean hands, take a small dab of Aquaphor and rub on palms6) pat face lightly with my palms and fingers to apply the aquaphor on top of the water. All it takes is a small amount of aquaphor. It absorbs quickly and it doesnt feel greasy for more than a few minutes.I hate lengthy bedtime beauty routines, but this is fast and easy. And it works.

  This product is a new favorite. I have a long history with issues of itchiness on my face and trying to keep my skin hydrated without getting pimples from overhydrating with creams or facial oils. I’ve used this product in a few ways - just as straight mist to my face, as moisture to mix with powdered face masks, and my favorite is as a base to mix with a drop of facial oil- I do this by putting a drop or two of oil in a separate spray bottle with about .5ml of this product, cap it, shake it vigorously, and spray it on my face. I truly notice a big difference in itchiness having used this product. Well worth the price. Will definitely be buying this product again.

  I was pretty excited about this product, but honestly I'm not too impressed. It's a hairspray bottle full of mineral water. I'm glad others love it and have seen great results, but for me it's just an overpriced water mister.

    bad reaction - acne
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  i found this spray to be alright out of this brands products.-ACNE PRONE SKIN WARNING-pretty much all this brand's products have caused my skin to break out a lot more. i stuck to the regimen for 3 months. i kept telling myself the bad bacteria has to come out before i can have clean and clear skin to keep me from stopping the regimen. a little after 2 months my skin started breaking out in HUGE, PAINFUL pimples. i kept using it though hoping to see a turn around soon. i finally decided to stop after 3 months of using it due to the pain. two weeks later my skin is almost clear except for a couple stubborn zits????? weird.anyways, that was my experience. hopefully i help other people with acne prone skin to make the risk whether to buy or not. i know everyone's skin type is different.

  I thought this seems like a useless product but it is a little addictive! It feels incredibly refreshing. I spray it on after my makeup, after a facial, if my skin is dry, if I’m hot if I’m stressed. I will probably always keep one of these on hand. I take it with me out of town as well. Great after a plane ride

    Magic
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I found all of the 5-star reviews to be true in my experience with this product. I use it first thing in the morning, spritzing it in my (long curly) hair, on my scalp, and on my face. Then I gently scrunch my hair and lightly massage my face which, I imagine, nicely mixes the water with my natural facial oils. My face is then incredibly soft and my second-day curly hair has regained its oomph. My ultimate goal is to swipe on some lip and brow color (after applying sunscreen) and consider myself ready to go out into the world; working on that goal. As other reviewers have said, might be my imagination, but the way my skin and hair feel after applying this product, I feel great, refreshed and ready to go.

    It's a cooling mist and I love it!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  It's water, for heaven's sake!  It's not a moisturizer, acne treatment or whatever.  It is water, thermal spring water from France.  I happen to love it, but cannot imagine expecting miracles from it.  I use it after washing my face to add that extra layer of moisture.  I let it semi-dry and then apply my favorite moisturizer.  For me, this is a great addition to my beauty routine and I really love that cool mist on my face after a shower.  I have used it for several years and have had zero problems with it.  My skin looks good enough that people comment on it and even the woman who does my facials has been complementary.  But that may just be down to genetics.  My mother had good skin too and she certainly never messed with expensive beauty products, just her Elizabeth Arden stuff.  I like good products and I love this cool spray of spring water after cleansing.

    Wonderful, magic water
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  It’s just water? But I love it??I use this in between layers of my skin care routine, when I’m sweaty and want a light refresh, or if my face is stinging after using an active skincare product. It cools my face down quickly and calms down any redness.If you use any products with hyaluronic acid, it’s good to apply on slightly damp skin so I’ll spray my face and then apply the moisturizer or serum. If your face is too dry and you’re in a dry environment HA can actually pull moisture out of your skin instead. This helps maximize the HA benefits.My skin is super dry in general so if my face dries fully in between skin care steps I’ll give it another spray with this before applying the next layer and then I can spread the product easier and use less product.This bottle seems pricey for what’s basically pressurized water but it’s honestly become a crucial part of my routine and I will keep buying it. My skin seems clearer since I started using it. It’s also lasted much longer than expected. I use it at least once a day most days, sometimes several times, and I’ve had it for 6+ months and it’s still at least 1/3 full.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I don't know how or why but this stuff makes my skin look amazing.  I spray it on after washing my face AM and PM, let it dry naturally and then proceed with my normal skincare routine.  I discovered it while researching products for Psoriasis and sensitive skin.  My Psoriasis cleared up after using Squaline, Medical Grade Skin Barrier and Oil Cleanser.  But this seemed to clear up the Psoriasis on my scalp where I really couldn't use the other products.  It is a very large bottle so I expect it will last a long time with just a spritz in the AM and PM.

  You could put NYC tap water in an aerosol can and it would feel and do exactly the same thing.  I ordered this after I couldn't decided on a new spritz toner.  The one I usually use is discontinued.  I knew exactly what I was getting, but I guess I got a little too excited after reading the reviews.  First, anyone who says ""it's basically water"" and is surprised but this....yes, yes it is water.  Simply water.  Second, remember that this is just water and don't be fooled by any rave reviews.  Cool misty water feels invigorating.  Cool misty water feels refreshing.  Cool misty water has the benefit of feeling cool and misty.  I'm giving 3 stars because the company has the gall to toot benefits other than ""cool and misty feels good"".  BUT I'm adding a star because it feels quite nice.  You know, cool and misty.

I’m not sure if it’s magic or what, but this product really helped - I healed in 3 days or less.Additionally, the mist is so refreshing! Now that I’m healed, I’m hooked and use this in my regimen day and night to refresh and moisturize.

  I initially thought the reviews were fake. But considering how sensitive and jacked my skin had become due to meds prescribed by a dermatologist, I was desperate.  In addition, I had these dark patches on my cheeks and forehead because the meds, pretty much burned my skin. This miracle water in a can is just that..A miracle.  I can still see the dark patches, but they are slowly being healed. I use it after I cleanse my skin, and sometimes during the day when those areas become irritated.  My skin no longer looks dry and cracked but moisturized. I will forever keep this product on hand as long as it is in production.

  Amazing product. I totally love it but I’m disappointed by price games Amazon plays. I purchased it for $18.50 on April 3rd and noticed that the price dropped by $4 not even 2 weeks later. Seriously?! So not cool.

  I love this product, but the bottle I was sent barely worked upon arrival and got worse within a few days. It is a full bottle but nothing comes out. It is a non returnable item so I’m stuck with a full bottle that was $20. I’m SO bummed. Possibly because of the pressure in the aerosol? I would recommend purchasing this product in a store if possible.

    Great results when used properly
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This is not a crock if you use it as intended and have appropriate expectations. This should not be used as a moisturizer alone as it is just WATER! Water alone left to dry on the skin will simply evaporate and take some of the water in your skin WITH IT (transepidermal water loss), thus potentially being more drying. However, the minerals in thermal water are thought to be beneficial for skin, such as by reducing inflammation, protecting against sun damage, moisturizing, etc (keeping in mind there are only a handful of flawed studies researching this).  The proper way to use thermal water spray is to follow-up immediately with an occlusive moisturizer. It will lock the beneficial thermal water into your skin thus plumping your skin and increasing hydration (temporarily, of course). In my personal experience, I have found that prepping my skin with Avene thermal water before moisturizing has increased the moisture levels in my skin on a day-to-day basis. I use either Cerave PM or First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Face Moisturizer (followed with sunscreen).

    Soothing and does wonders for sensitive skin
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I was introduced to this facial spray by someone who has probably the best skin I've seen. She doesn't have sensitive skin but says she loves how it always leaves her skin feeling soft and moisturized. When I first tried this, it didn't really stand out as anything ""magical"" like others have suggested in their reviews, but it did feel very light and refreshing. After using it for a couple of weeks, I noticed that there's significantly less redness on my face, which is a good thing because when I get sunburns it used to take much longer for the redness to diminish. One thing to note though, this thermal water might not be as moisturizing as some people might expect. If you have combination to dry skin, you still want to apply some moisturizer after this. Taking one star off because the nozzle could be improved. The second bottle I got has a defective nozzle that only has mist coming from the two ends and none from the center, resulting in very uneven mist and sometimes water streams instead of mist, which is less soothing than it would be if it came with a proper nozzle.

  I previously purchased the 5 oz and loved it. It's a fantastic product and helps calm my skin. However, the 10 oz does not measure up. First, the cap is loose - it doesn't even properly stay on. It arrived dented. It sprays unevenly and leaks out the back. Pretty disappointing. If you have the choice, choose a smaller size than the 10 oz.

  Big bottle. Nice fine mist. Face looking too powdery after applying makeup? ""Hold my beer.""  Great to spray on immediately prior to a hydrator when face is still wet (especially hyaluronic acid) to lock some h20 in there. Would tap water do the same thing? Probably, but this may actually be more soothing (jury is out) plus it's from France therefor far more luxurious.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I first heard about this as a tumblr review for eczema sufferers. For the last year, I have been suffering from a severe eczema outbreak as a result of mold exposure. I've dropped more dough on OTC cures, dermatologist visits, medicated creams and ointments, than I ever though humanly possible. So, when I saw the tumblr post, I thought, what the hell do I have to lose? I've rubbed vitamin E supplements and covered them in cling wrap to cure this mess, so why not try some fancy French mineral water?Before I sprayed it on, I was covered in dry, red patches, itched like there was a colony of ants under my skin, and had about given up my sanity. After I sprayed myself head to toe, the itching was gone, and my most stubborn patches were 80% improved after about an hour of spraying. By the second day of using this product, one of the physicians I work with commented that the dermatologist must have gotten the right medication combo for me. They were so surprised when I told them the major money I'd spent at the Derm Clinic had nothing to do with my recovery!Buy this. It is insanely amazingly magical.

  I love this product it makes my skin very hydrated and it just feels great. The problem I’m having is I did not receive my package the mailman gave it to just any resident that lives here and never reached my unit somebody stole my package. And the mailman should’ve came and put my package by my door instead he handed it to a resident and it wasn’t me. I’m very angry about it and I’m having this association look at the cameras to see who took my  package! I have a PO Box but this product isn’t sent to a PO Box so I guess I have to go buy it from my dermatologist because if I order again and it gets stolen again because the mail man is an idiot and won’t put it by the residence door. Very unhappy with the mail service. It cost me more to buy it at My dermatologist

  I know this seems ridiculous, but I promise, it is not. It seems to calm and refresh my skin and it also feels amazing. I use it as a toner. First, I wash my face using Avene cleanser (the blue one), I spray this on and let it dry, and then I use the Embryolisse lait-creme concentre moisturizer. It is a perfect skin care routine that works and is actually a lot less expensive than most other alternatives. Try it. I bet you will be pleasantly surprised.One small thing to bear in mind is that this is a large container; it didn't fit in my medicine cabinet.

    A Must Have
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  This mist isn't everything I hoped for but it certainly packs a punch. My skin is definitely clearer and softer when I use it. When my skin feels burny, itchy, or bumpy, this spray cures it all. I know I haven't used it when my skin isn't as clear. It takes a couple days to kick in but even if you only use it once a day, you'll see a difference. For the best results, I definitely use several times a day, usually four (morning/evening plus two more times). It provides some instant relief but for the most part, takes time to work.

  A lot of hype and a bit overpriced. A booklet I have from the brand shows thermal imaging of a face three minutes after spraying with this water. However, they don't show pictures of a face sprayed with cool tap water, which would likely show similar results. I guess it's a guilty pleasure. I've used it for a long time to moisten my face before moisturizer, treatments, and makeup. I've just started using it as a toner by spraying it on a cotton round. Haven't noticed a major difference between this and two cheaper brands I've used in the past. But it's much more useful than a plastic spray bottle of water, as the mist is far finer.

  This stuff was introduced to me years ago via a man who got it from his dermatologist.  I use it to help moisturize while not breaking me out like most products do.  I call it magic water because it truly is.  I just sprayed it on my broken out face a few hours ago and already my skin is soft as a babies booty but also the redness is diminished.  It's healing water. No joke, no scam, worth every penny.  Works well on hives also.  I recommend this as a daily regimen to aid against the wrinkles of time as well.  Treat your body to this amazing treat from mother nature.  I actually order the large bottle for home and the smaller bottle for my purse/travel etc.

  Hands-down the best spring water mist. I used to use Evian for years and there’s no comparison. Even La Roche-Posay’s thermal face mist pales in comparison. I use this mist to keep my skin damp between the shower and when I apply my skincare.  This process absolutely helps keep my skin hydrated. It’s also nice to keep a bottle on my bedside table to mist myself at night or in the morning. Refreshing, hydrating, and cooling.

Can't see any downside except that it will run out fast the way I use it, maybe.  Will have to see about that.

    Magical Fairy Juice!!!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  You may be thinking, as I did, what a crock! Well you would be wrong! You see, I got a small bottle of this in my monthly ipsy bag. I laughed. A bottle of water? I tossed it in a basket in my home office and there it sat for months. Then one day I was working and I was really hot, I decided to spray this water on my face rather than walk my lazy butt into the other room to wash my face. Dear god, this was refreshing! My face felt, dare I say it, Magical! I read the bottle, I looked it up online, there just had to be some sort of illegal ingredient in it for it to make my face to feel the way that it did. I don't know how or why, nor do I really care anymore, but this stuff is amazing. There is not a single day that goes by that I do not use it. I have a travel bottle, I have a bottle for my purse and I have the largest bottle that sits on my vanity. Whenever your face needs a pick-me-up, right before you apply foundation, when you're hot, when you're sad, when you have just eaten a gallon of ice cream and feel defeated, spray this on your face, you will feel better about yourself instantly. I have told my friends about it and they don't believe me. Then I spray them with it, then they buy it. I'm telling you.....Fairy juice! It's worth every penny!

  I ordered this because of that viral user review on Reddit, in which the reviewer said it almost instantly relieved her eczema.... so I bought it for my daughter along with the XeraCalm A.D. creme to be used together. Well unfortunately it had no effect on her eczema and a little rash on her face, so she's no longer using it...I also used it with the creme on my lichen planus (skin condition similar to eczema) and saw no change. So I'm using it under my moisturizer as a facial spray! Works just fine for that and feels great when used, but I wouldn't necessarily purchase again given the price. Also I can't say its making a difference with my skin because I use lots of different products, but again it does feel refreshing when used.

  I love this thermal spring water. This is really the first time that I have used this type of a product. But it really does do everything it says it does. It will help remove your makeup and hydrate your skin. It will help with sun burns and rashes. I use this on my clients who have dry, normal, or combination skin. I will NOT use this on someone who is oily, and I will only use this on combination skin on the areas that are dehydrated. I use this for myself as well, of course. My son also broke out in a rash from something and this really helped hydrate his skin and take some of the itchy pain away (poor guy).  I can't believe it took me this long to try this. Plus the bottle is huge and it will last forever. I don't think I can live without this!

  SInce I can't  return this, I am going to give one star.  I only used one day and  the spray  valve stopped working. As a result, I cannot use this at all. What a junk and piece of crap!  Very disappointed !

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Honestly I'd give it more stars if possible. I had scalp psoriasis and this helps more than any oil or cream I've ever used including prescriptions. I section my hair off and spray it onto my scalp. Honestly it's like automatic relief from the itching and burning. It doesn't make it goi away or anything but boy does it feel wonderful.

    Sooths my seborrheic dermatitis, keeps me fresh
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I suffer from seborrheic dermatitis, it plagues my scalp, forehead, eyebrows, beard. You know, my general face area. It's bad enough looking like a lizard person all of the time because I have flakes all over my face, but for those of you who don't know, it can be physically irritating. Think of a burning-itchy sensation akin to mild sunburn. This spring water keeps that feeling in check, along with the urge to scratch or rub my face. I use this every day, several times a day and I love the simplicity of it and the fact that I don't have to plaster some goop all over my face that leaves it all oily and icky. This is just plain old water from a thermal spring. I can tell you that it's not tap water because tap water does not achieve these results. There is something soothing about this water due to its mineral composition. It's not magic and it's not going to heal me as this is something that until now, has no cure, but it sure as hell makes my face feel fresh and not all stretchy and cardboard-like.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I have a minor case of rosacea and my dermatologist once recommended this to appease my skin. That was some twenty years ago and I still use it to this day. It doesn't claim that it will fix the problem and yet, it calms and soothes my skin almost instantly. I also use it on very hot days to cool myself down. I have dry skin and this does tend to dry out my skin a little bit after I apply it, but I follow up with a tiny bit of moisturizer after it has dried out and it's all back to normal.
